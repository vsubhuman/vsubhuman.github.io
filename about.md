## Myself

Ruslan Dudin (`@vsubhuman`), a professional software developer since 2013, few years as a hobby before that. Spent years answering questions on russian Java forums. Contributed test questions to russian coding quiz websites. Worked at companies like [DevExperts](https://devexperts.com/) and [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company/). Currently working as a lead-dev at [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/our-products), leading teams of developers on public open-source projects like [Yoroi Wallet](https://yoroi-wallet.com) and private enterprise projects like [Emurgo Traceability](https://emurgo-traceability.com/).

#### Principles

- A programming language is a tool, not a paradigm.
- Using a framework should not be a default choice. 
- Becoming even a tiny fraction better than before is greater than stagnation and worth the effort.
- Refactoring must be a daily routine, not an occasional hackathon.
- Best of plans sometimes fail, analysing and trying to improve is the path forward.
- A project with no good practices is not a lost hope, change one tiny thing to right in that project today.
- Multi-paradigm over purism, having 10% of functional code in a project is better than 0%.
- Being 10% agile is better than 0% agile. Every iteration is a chance to improve the process.
- Monads are overrated.
- // todo
